    "#### Zener diode clipper\n",
    "A Zener diode clipper is designed to limit voltage accurately with minimal components, avoiding the need for biasing voltage required in traditional bias diode clippers. The Zener diode behaves like a normal diode when forward-biased, but conducts above its Zener voltage in reverse, necessitating a series resistor to prevent damage. It clips both cycles, limited by the forward voltage drop during negative cycles and conducting above Zener voltage during positive cycles.\n",

    "The previous section explored diode configurations that clip signals. This section examines diode configurations that shift signals to different levels, focusing on clamper networks consisting of a diode, resistor, and capacitor. These networks shift the signal's DC level without altering its shape, relying on a sufficiently large time constant to maintain the capacitor's charge.\n",

    "A clamping circuit restores the DC level of a signal and shifts the output signal to the positive portion of the input. During the negative half cycle, the capacitor charges to the peak value, and in the positive half cycle, the signal is positively clamped, resulting in an output that shifts according to the input changes.\n",

    "During the positive half cycle of the input AC signal, the diode is forward biased, allowing current to charge the capacitor to the peak input voltage. During the negative half cycle, the diode is reverse biased, preventing current flow, and the stored charge in the capacitor combines with the input voltage to produce an output voltage of $ -2V_m $, resulting in a downward-shifted signal.\n",
