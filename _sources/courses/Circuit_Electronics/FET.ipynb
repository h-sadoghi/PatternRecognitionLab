    "## Overview and Fundamentals of FETs\n",
    "\n",
    "Field-effect transistors (FETs) are crucial electronic components in modern electronics, offering low power consumption, high input impedance, and simple biasing requirements. This article explores the history of FETs, from early inventions and patents to modern developments and applications. We delve into FET types, their working principles, and key specifications, providing a comprehensive understanding of these essential devices. FETs can be classified into two main types: Junction Field-Effect Transistor (JFET) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working Principles and Historical Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "FETs operate by controlling the current flow through a semiconductor channel using a voltage applied at the gate terminal. The gate voltage modulates the number of charge carriers in the channel, affecting current flow between the source and drain terminals. The field-effect principle forms the basis of FET operation. The development of FETs began with Julius Edgar Lilienfeld's patent in 1926 and evolved through contributions from Oskar Heil and the team at Bell Labs, leading to modern FET technology. "
