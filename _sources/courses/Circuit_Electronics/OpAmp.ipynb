    "The operational amplifier (op-amp), originating in the 1940s with vacuum tubes, performs mathematical operations like addition and subtraction. An op-amp is a high-gain differential amplifier characterized by its high input impedance and low output impedance. The differential amplifier circuit, a fundamental configuration in integrated circuits (ICs), is widely utilized due to its versatility. As illustrated in following Figure, this circuit features two distinct inputs and outputs, with the emitters connected together. While many differential amplifier circuits rely on dual voltage supplies, they can also function with a single supply, highlighting their adaptability in various applications.\n",

Therefore, the input impedance of the differential amplifier must be High. As shown below with the equivalent circuit, $ R_i $ represents the input impedance in the equivalent circuit."
