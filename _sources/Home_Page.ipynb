Even in newly emerging fields like PySpice, where ChatGPT doesn't fully understand electronics, its bold attempts at writing, though imperfect, gave me the courage to proceed with my own work. I hope that one day, with its help, humans will master all sciences, enabling the seamless transfer of knowledge and empowering humanity to build a world free from cruelty and war._\n",
